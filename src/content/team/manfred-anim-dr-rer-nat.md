I‚Äôm a clinical researcher with a PhD in Immunology and extensive hands-on experience in next-generation sequencing (NGS), including whole-exome sequencing, single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and immunohistochemistry. I lead translational research projects, focusing on chronic hepatitis B and D, as well as human genetics.

My expertise spans molecular and immunological techniques, clinical study design, and bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput data. I‚Äôm passionate about uncovering disease mechanisms, identifying biomarkers, and translating complex biological data into actionable insights for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics.

I excel at designing and optimising experimental protocols, collaborating across disciplines, and solving complex scientific challenges with precision and creativity.

üîç Currently open to new opportunities in biotech, pharma, or clinical R&D ‚Äî particularly roles involving NGS, biomarker discovery, immune profiling, or translational medicine. Let‚Äôs connect if you're looking for a scientist who blends immunology expertise with cutting-edge genomic technologies.
