project enhances operational efficiency and service delivery while contributing
to climate mitigation and energy sustainability.

### Goal:

 To promote clean, affordable, and
reliable energy solutions that improve service delivery in rural clinics,
schools, and community centers.

### Expected Impact:

 Reduced energy costs and power
outages, improved public service delivery, and creation of model
climate-resilient communities.

### Core Focus Area:

 ISIR Ghana promotes research, advocacy, and innovation in
renewable energy to strengthen climate adaptation and sustainability.

Key Performance
Indicators (KPI):
